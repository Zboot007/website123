                Our latest research sheds light on the six attributes—key
                success factors—that regardless of sector allow the most
                advanced companies to outperform, withstand shocks and
                disruptions, and exploit innovation for value-creating growth.
                In addition, we have identified the steps companies must
                take—and how best to take them—to reach the coveted position of
                being a company that is built for the future.

                The C-Suite’s Blueprint to Building Competitive Advantage
            </p>
            <p>
                How do companies deliver both near-term performance and
                sustainable advantage? Leaders need to drive programmatic change
                before they transition to continuous year-over-year improvement.
                They need a blueprint that identifies which capabilities to
                build and how to best execute investments to maximize their
                return. While the specifics of this agenda will vary by sector
                and each company’s unique context, a clear path has emerged that
                all companies must follow to build for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Critical to this journey is developing the six
                attributes—already demonstrated by leading organizations—that
                are key factors for success, allowing companies to move into
                high-growth markets and seize new opportunities.

            Our research at hundreds of companies across industries suggests
            that building these attributes and critical capabilities is a
            multistage journey. Many players are stagnating, unable to even
            start to lay the foundation for a digital transformation. Most are
            emerging. They are reaping some transformation benefits but are
            challenged to drive solutions across the organization. A select few
            are scaling capabilities, and even fewer are future built, having
            developed the capabilities that will allow them to grow from driving
            innovation to, ultimately, being on the leading edge of disruption.
